After a certain lifetime, a particle splits into kgeq 0 identical, independent offspring particles with probability p_k. This process is repeated indefinitely, producing a collection of N(t) particles at time t. Splitting happens with a rate function gamma(xtau) that may depend on the current state x and age tau of the particle.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"Examples of such processes are:","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"Classical branching processes, which correspond to the case X(t)equiv 1.\nBranching Brownian motion\nBranching Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes used in phylogenetic comparative methods","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"Although the package can probably be used or extended for generic phylodynamic analyses, the dedicated PhyloTraits package will probably be more appropriate for that purpose.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"The primary motivation for this package is to provide a framework for the analysis of a \"memory\" phenomenon that can occur in branching stochastic processes if the relaxation rate of the single-particle dynamics is slow relative to the branching rate. In this case the system can remember its initial state, or, put differently, large fluctuations early in the expansion can have a long-lasting effect on the state of the system. The study of this phenomenon implicitly traces its roots (no pun intended) to Luria and Delbrück's fluctuation analysis.
