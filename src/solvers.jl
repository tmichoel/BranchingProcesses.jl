Solve a branching stochastic process with constant branching rate defined by the `ConstantRateBranchingProblem` `bp`. The positional argument `alg` and optional keyword arguments `kwargs...` are passed to the solver used to sample trajectories of the underlying SDE problem.

Returns a [`BranchingProcessSolution`](@ref) containing the problem definition and the resulting tree structure.

Recursively solve a branching stochastic process where the single-particle dynamics is defined by the SDE problem `prob`, the branching rate is a constant `λ`, and the number of children `nchild` of each particle is either a non-negative integer or a discrete distribution from which the number of children is sampled. The positional argument `alg` and optional keyword arguments `kwargs...` are passed to the solver used to sample the trajectory of each particle.

The timespan of the problem `prob` defines the total time interval for the branching process. A lifetime for the first particle is sampled from an exponential distribution with rate `λ`. If the lifetime is larger than the total time interval, the problem is solved until the end of the original interval and a solution node is returned without children. If the lifetime is smaller than the total time interval, the problem is solved until the sampled lifetime, and a solution node is returned with recursively solved children for the remaining time interval.

Returns a [`BranchingProcessNode`](@ref) representing the tree structure.
